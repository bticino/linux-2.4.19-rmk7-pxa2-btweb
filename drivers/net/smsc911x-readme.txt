############### REVISION HISTORY ######################
#######################################################
06/04/2004 Bryan Whitehead. Version 0.50:
This is the first beta version

06/21/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.51:
added multicast
added private ioctls to set mac address and write eeprom (not tested)
removed timeout function, which served no purpose anyway.

07/09/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.52
Improved Flow Control
More Control on Link Management
   the driver parameter link_mode is now a bit wise field that
     specifies any combination of 4 or fewer link speeds
     1=10HD,2=10FD,4=100HD,8=100FD
     Still Autonegotiation is always used.

07/13/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.53
EEPROM has been fixed and tested.
   If there is an EEPROM connected and loaded correctly, its
     mac address will be loaded into the 11x
Improved Flow Control again. Measured >10X improvement 
    in UDP_STREAM test with small packets.

07/30/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.54
Added many IOCTL codes for use with the command app, cmd911x.
Added functions to the Platform interface
	Platform_RequestDmaChannel
	Platform_ReleaseDmaChannel
Added Macros to Platform interface
	PLATFORM_DEFAULT_RX_DMA
	PLATFORM_DEFAULT_TX_DMA

08/12/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.55
Updated driver documentation
Consolidated most driver source files into smsc911x.c
Minor changes to the platform interface

08/13/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.56
Added Ioctl COMMAND_GET_CONFIGURATION
  this command used with "cmd911x -cGET_CONFIG"
  will display driver information, which is especially
  useful if trace points have been disabled.
  
08/24/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.57
Implemented software patch to resynchronize Rx fifos after an
overrun is detected.

08/24/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.58
Turned on LEDs which were accidentally turned off in version 0.57

08/25/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.59
Added extra driver context variables useful for debugging
They can be accessed with the following command
# cmd911x -cGET_CONFIG

08/30/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.60
Fixed bug in software patch (0.57) that caused the receiver to be turned
off and not turned back on.
Added symple packet filter to detect bad packets. If a bad packet
is detected the driver will handle it like an overrun. That is, turn off
receiver, empty fifos, clear fifo pointers(RX_DUMP), and turn on receiver. 
This method allows the driver to recover after a fifo synchronization fault.

09/01/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.61
This version was used for testing the patch. It was for internal purposes only

09/03/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.62
This version fixes some bugs in 0.60 and includes extra work around code
to improve patch reliability.

09/07/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.63
Added IOCTLs for reading and writing to general memory

09/13/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.64
As the hardware issue is now fully understood, this patch includes
a few changes to make the work around reliable in all situations.
This version also has a the beginnings of new flow control feature,
however this feature is disable for this version because it is
still in progress.
The build process has also changed. Now instead of building one
debug driver, you can build a release and debug driver by choosing
to include or not include the define USE_DEBUG. The release version
enables activity LEDs, and removes all trace, warning, and assertion 
messages. The debug version enables GPIO signals, and enables trace, 
warning, and assertion messages.

09/15/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.65
Removed packet filter from 0.64
Added non-Auto-Negotiate link modes. See description of the 
  link_mode driver parameter below
  
09/28/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.66/0.67
Added Rx flow control which is only turned on when the driver
detects a lack of flow control in the higher layers.

10/07/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.68
Added support for Peakslite, and Polaris.
Implemented support for Phy management tools 
  such as mii-diag and mii-tool.
  
10/13/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.69
Fixed some issues with Linux 2.6.

10/18/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.70
Added support for new chips 115, 116, 117. 
	NOTE: 115, and 116 may still require bus timing
		adjustment.
Disabled workaround when rev b is detected. 

10/20/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 0.71/0.72
Added support for tasklets, which allow the bulk of the
Rx processing to be done with out blocking interrupts for
the rest of the system.

10/27/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.00
Tuned the PLATFORM_INT_DEAS for sh3 platforms to get better
TCP performance. Bumped up version number to 1.00 because this
will be the first official release.

10/27/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.01
Changed sh3 POLARIS platform to use cycle steal DMA

11/11/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.02/1.03
Changed tasklets to default to off, (tasklets=0)
Testing has shown that tasklets are not stable yet. So changing the
default allows us to release this version. The user may still turn
tasklets on but does so at there own risk. 

11/11/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.04
Fixed Tasklet Issue.
Changed tasklets to be ON by default, (tasklets=1)

11/18/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.05
Improved software flow control.
Updated platform code to handle all chips 118/117/116/115

11/19/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.06
Added support to provide separate flow control parameters
  for 118/117 and 116/115. And the driver will use which
  ever is appropriate.

11/23/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.07
Changed the driver so that PAUSE frames will be enable or disabled
based on state of the local and remote pause bits, as specified in
IEEE Standard 802.3, 2000 Edition, page 1360, Table 28B-3-Pause Resolution

12/01/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.08
Added support for external phy.
To enable use of external phy use the follow driver parameter setting
    ext_phy=1
other wise the driver will use the internal phy as it always has before.

12/01/2004 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.09
replace the ext_phy parameter with phy_addr which works as follows
if(phy_addr==0xFFFFFFFF) {
	//use internal phy
} else if (phy_addr<32) {
	//use external phy at address specified by phy_addr
	//  if external phy can not be found use internal phy
} else {
	//attempt to auto detect external phy
	//  if external phy can not be found use internal phy
}

02/14/2005 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.11
Automated the tuning procedure. See RX PERFORMANCE TUNING.
Changed all register access to use a Macro instead of 
   a memory mapped structure. This should simplify porting,
   if register access is ever done through IO space.
Tuned all current platforms.
Increased time out of Rx_FastForward to 500.
Fixed faulty define TX_CMD_A_BUF_SIZE_
Fixed faulty define TX_CMD_B_PKT_BYTE_LENGTH_
Changed Phy reset to use PHY_BCR_RESET
Cleaned driver with Lint tool
Updated Rx_CountErrors
	Only count length error if length/type field is set
	If there is a CRC error don't count length error or
	  multicast
Changed access to Mac and Phy registers. Now requires only
	one lock, MacPhyLock. This replaces the MacAccessLock,
	PhyAccessLock, and RxSwitchLock.
	
02/28/2005 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.12
Added date_code static constant

02/28/2005 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.13
Added support for LAN9112

03/21/2005 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.13
Updated Platforms ".h" file to include a version number in
   the PLATFORM_NAME macro. This version number is platform
   specific and independent of the common code version 
   number.
Merged in STMICRO platform code to release tree

03/22/2005 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.13
Updated platform code see st40.c for changes

03/23/2005 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.13
Changed the format of the platform version to rN,
  where N is the number of the platform revision.
  This is visible in the PLATFORM_NAME macro.
  
04/11/2005 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.14
Added Platform_CleanUp function, to be used in the event
	that a particular platform should release resources
	when the driver is unloaded from memory
Moved register access and data port access from common 
	code to platform code. This is to support the 
	possibility that a big endian system may need to do 
	byte swapping.
Changed Lan_SetRegDW to use Platform_SetRegDW
Changed Lan_GetRegDW to use Platform_GetRegDW
Changed Lan_ClrBitsDW to use Platform_S/GetRegDW
Changed Lan_SetBitsDW to use Platform_S/GetRegDW
Changed Tx_WriteFifo to Platform_WriteFifo
Changed Rx_ReadFifo to Platform_ReadFifo
Changed the way platform files are included.
	Now the Macros PLATFORM_HEADER and PLATFORM_SOURCE
	will define a string that is the path to those
	header and source files.

04/15/2005 Bryan Whitehead, Version 1.15
Migrated source control to perforce.
Merged platform ".h" and ".c" file to a single
	platform ".c" file

05/26/2005 M David Gelbman, Version 1.16
Integrated Beacon PHY work-around into both Concord and
Beacon versions.
LED1 - 10/100 LED activity corrected to go OFF when link

smsc911x.c: Main driver source code file.
       This file contains all platform independent code
       It also includes platform dependent code based
       on the following defines
          USE_SH3
          USE_PEAKS
          USE_XSCALE
       One of these should be defined in the build batch file
        or makefile

peaks.h
xscale.h
sh3.h
      These files are platform dependent files. They define
      the platform dependent structure, PLATFORM_DATA.
      They also define some platform dependent constants for
      use by smsc911x.c. see PLATFORM INTERFACE DESCRIPTIONS
      below for more information
      
peaks.c
xscale.c
sh3.c
       These files implement the platform dependent functions
       used by smsc911x.c. see PLATFORM INTERFACE DESCRIPTIONS
       below for more information      

ioctl_11x.h
      defines ioctl codes common between the driver(smsc911x.c)
      and the helper application (cmd911x.c)
      
cmd911x.c
       This is the source code for the helper application.
       It provides the means by which one can send any ioctl code
       to the driver (smsc911x.c).

############################################################
################## DRIVER PARAMETERS #######################
############################################################
The following are load time modifiable driver parameters.
They can be set when using insmod
Example:
# insmod smsc911x.o rx_dma=0 tx_dma=1 irq=5

lan_base
    specifies the physical base location in memory where the 
    LAN911x can be accessed. By default the location will be
    choosen by Platform_Initialize.
    
bus_width
    specifies the bus_width to be configured by
    Platform_Initialize. Must be set to either 16, or 32.
    Any other value or by default Platform_Initialize will 
    attempt to autodetect the bus width
    

link_mode
    specifies the link mode used. Each bit has different meanings
      bit 0, 0x01, 10Mbps Half Duplex,
      bit 1, 0x02, 10Mbps Full Duplex,
      bit 2, 0x04, 100Mbps Half Duplex,
      bit 3, 0x08, 100Mbps Full Duplex,
      bit 4, 0x10, Symmetrical Pause,
      bit 5, 0x20, Asymmetrical Pause,
      bit 6, 0x40, Auto Negotiate,
      
    if bit 6 is set, then Auto Negotiation is used, and bits 0 through 5
      define what modes are advertised. 
      
    if bit 6 is clear, then Auto Negotiation is not used, and bits 0 
      through 3 select which speed and duplex setting to use. In this case, 
      only the most significant set bit is used to set the speed and duplex.
      Example, the following are bits 6 to 0, and the resulting setting
      bits 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
           0 x x 0 0 0 x, 10Mbps Half Duplex
           0 x x 0 0 1 x, 10Mbps Full Duplex
           0 x x 0 1 x x, 100Mbps Half Duplex
           0 x x 1 x x x, 100Mbps Full Duplex
           
    by default link_mode=0x7F which uses Auto Negotiation and advertises
       all modes.
    
irq
    specifies the irq number to use. The default value is decided
    by the platform layer with the macro PLATFORM_IRQ
    
int_deas
    specifies the interrupt deassertion period to be written to
    INT_DEAS of INT_CFG register. The default value is decided by
    the platform layer with the macro PLATFORM_INT_DEAS
    
irq_pol
    specifies the value to be written to IRQ_POL of INT_CFG register.
    The default value is decided by the platform layer with the 
    macro PLATFORM_INT_POL.
    
irq_type
    specifies the value to be written to IRQ_TYPE of INT_CFG register.
    The default value is decided by the platform layer with the 
    macro PLATFORM_IRQ_TYPE
    
rx_dma
    specifies the dma channel to use for receiving packets. It may
    also be set to the following values
        256 = TRANSFER_PIO
            the driver will not use dma, it will use PIO.
        255 = TRANSFER_REQUEST_DMA
            the driver will call the Platform_RequestDmaChannel
            to get an available dma channel
    the default value is decided by the platform layer with the 
    macro PLATFORM_RX_DMA
        
tx_dma
    specifies the dma channel to use for transmitting packets. It may
    also be set to the following values
        256 = TRANSFER_PIO
            the driver will not use dma, it will use PIO.
        255 = TRANSFER_REQUEST_DMA
            the driver will call the Platform_RequestDmaChannel
            to get an available dma channel
    the default value is decided by the platform layer with the 
    macro PLATFORM_TX_DMA

dma_threshold
    specifies the minimum size a packet must be for using DMA. 
    Otherwise the driver will use PIO. For small packets PIO may
    be faster than DMA because DMA requires a certain amount of set
    up time where as PIO can start almost immediately. Setting this
    value to 0 means dma will always be used where dma has been enabled.

    The default value is decided by the platform layer with the
    macro PLATFORM_DMA_THRESHOLD
    
mac_addr_hi16
    Specifies the high word of the mac address. If it was not 
    specified then the driver will try to read the mac address 
    from the eeprom. If that failes then the driver will set it 
    to a valid value. Both mac_addr_hi16 and mac_addr_lo32 must be 
    used together or not at all.
    
mac_addr_lo32
    Specifies the low dword of the mac address. If it was not 
    specified then the driver will try to read the mac address 
    from the eeprom. If that failes then the driver will set it to 
    a valid value. Both mac_addr_hi16 and mac_addr_lo32 must be 
    used together or not at all.
    
debug_mode
    specifies the debug mode
        0x01, bit 0 display trace messages
        0x02, bit 1 display warning messages
        0x04, bit 2 enable GPO signals
    Trace messages will only display if the driver was compiled
        with USE_TRACE defined.
    Warning message will only display if the driver was compiled
        with USE_WARNING defined.

tx_fifo_sz
    specifies the value to write to TX_FIFO_SZ of the 
    HW_CFG register. It should be set to a value from 0 to 15
    that has been left shifted 16 bits.
    The default value is 0x00050000UL
    
afc_cfg
    specifies the value to write to write to the AFC_CFG register
    during initialization. By default the driver will choose a value
    that seems resonable for the tx_fifo_sz setting. However it
    should be noted that the driver has only be tested using the 
    default setting for tx_fifo_sz
    
tasklets
	A non zero value specifies that most of the receive work 
	should be done in a tasklet, thereby enabling other system interrupts.
	A zero value specifies that all receive work is done in the ISR,
	where interrupts are not enabled. A single burst of receive work has
	been seen to take as long as 3 mS. It would not be friendly for this
	driver to hold the CPU for that long, there for tasklets are enabled
	by default. However there are some tests that measure a mild performance 
	drop when using tasklets, therefor this parameter is included so the 
	end user can choose to disable tasklets.
	NOTE:10/29/2004: as of version 1.02 tasklets are disabled by default because
	testing has not confirmed their stability. The user may still turn on
	tasklets but does so at there own risk.
	NOTE:11/05/2004: as of version 1.04 tasklets are enabled by default because
	the issue observed before has been solved.
	    
phy_addr
	The default value of 0xFFFFFFFF tells the driver to use the internal phy.
	A value less than or equal to 31 tells the driver to use the external phy
	    at that address. If the external phy is not found the internal phy
	    will be used.
	Any other value tells the driver to search for the external phy on all
	    addresses from 0 to 31. If the external phy is not found the internal 
	    phy will be used.
	
max_throughput
    This is one of the software flow control parameters. It specifies the 
    maximum throughput in a 100mS period that was measured during an rx 
    TCP_STREAM test. It is used to help the driver decide when to activate 
    software flow control and what work load to maintain when flow control 
    is active. By default the driver will decide what value to use.
    See RX PERFORMANCE TUNING.
    
max_packet_count
	This is one of the software flow control parameters. It specifies the
	maximum packets counted in a 100mS period during an rx TCP_STREAM test.
	It is used to help the driver decide when to activate software flow
	control, and what work load to maintain when flow control is active.
	By default the driver will decide what value to use.
	See RX PERFORMANCE TUNING.
	
packet_cost
	This is one of the software flow control parameters. It specifies the
	ideal packet cost. This allows the driver achieve the best performance
	with both large and small packets, when flow control is active.
	By default the driver will decide what value to use.
	See RX PERFORMANCE TUNING.

burst_period
	This is one of the software flow control parameters. When flow control is active
	the driver will do work in bursts. This value specifies the length of 
	the burst period in 100uS units. By default the driver will decide what value to
	use. See RX PERFORMANCE TUNING.

max_work_load
	This is one of the software flow control parameters. It specifies the amount
	of work the driver can do in a 100mS period. By default it is set as
	max_work_load = max_throughput + (max_packet_count*packet_cost);
	See RX PERFORMANCE TUNING.

################# RX PERFORMANCE TUNING ###################
###########################################################

Under most real world conditions traffic is flow controlled at
the upper layers of the protocol stack. The most common example is 
TCP traffic. Even UDP traffic is usually flow controlled in the sense 
that the transmitter does not normally send continuous wirespeed traffic.
When high level flow control is in use, it usually produces the
best performance on its own with no intervention from the driver.
But if high level flow control is not in use, then the driver will be 
working as fast as it can to receive packets and pass them up to 
the OS. In doing so it will hog CPU time and the OS may drop packets
due to lack of an ability to process them. It has been found that
during these heavy traffic conditions, throughput can be significantly
improved if the driver voluntarily releases the CPU. Yes, this will
cause more packets to be dropped on the wire but a greater number
of packets are spared because the OS has more time to process them.

As of version 1.05 and later, the driver implements a new flow control
detection method that operates like this. If the driver detects an
excessive work load in the period of 100mS, then the driver
assumes there is insufficient flow control in use. Therefor it will 
turn on driver level flow control. Which significantly reduces the 
amount of time the driver holds the CPU, and causes more packets to
be dropped on the wire. So a balancing/tuning, needs to be performed
on each system to get the best performance under these conditions. 
If however the driver detects a tolerable work load in a period of 
100mS then it assumes flow control is being managed well and does 
not attempt to intervene by releasing the CPU. Under these conditions
the driver will naturally release the CPU to the OS, since the system
as a whole is keeping up with traffic.

Now that the background has been discussed, its necessary to talk 
about how the driver implements flow control. The method used is a 
work load model. This is similar but not exactly the same as 
throughput. Work load is the sum of all the packet sizes plus a constant
packet cost for each packet. This provides more balance. For instance
a stream of max size packets will give a large throughput with fewer
packets, while a stream of min size packets will give a low throughput
with many packets. Adding a per packet cost to the work load allows these
two cases to both activate and manage flow control. If work load only 
counted packet sizes then only a stream of max size packets would
activate flow control, while a stream of min size packets would not.

There are five primary parameters responsible for managing flow control.
They can be found in the FLOW_CONTROL_PARAMETERS structure. 
They are
	MaxThroughput, Represents the maximum throughput measured in a 
		100mS period, during an rx TCP_STREAM test.		
	MaxPacketCount, Represents the maximum packet count measured in a 
		100mS period, during an rx TCP_STREAM test.
	PacketCost, Represents the optimal per packet cost
	BurstPeriod, Represents the optimal burst period in 100uS units.
	IntDeas, This is the value for the interrupt deassertion period.
	    It is set to INT_DEAS field of the INT_CFG register.
The driver will call Platform_GetFlowControlParameters to get these

parameters for the specific platform and current configuration.
These parameters must be carefully choosen by the driver writer so
optimal performance can be achieved. Therefor it is necessary to 
describe how the driver uses each parameter.

The first three parameters MaxThroughput, MaxPacketCount, and PacketCost,
are used to calculate the secondary parameter, MaxWorkLoad according
to the following formula.
	MaxWorkLoad=MaxThroughput+(MaxPacketCount*PacketCost);
MaxWorkLoad represents the maximum work load the system can handle during
a 100mS period.
	The driver will use MaxWorkLoad and BurstPeriod to determine 
BurstPeriodMaxWorkLoad, which represents the maximum amount of work the 
system can handle during a single burst period. It is calculated as follows
	BurstPeriodMaxWorkLoad=(MaxWorkLoad*BurstPeriod)/1000;

Every 100mS the driver measures the CurrentWorkLoad by the following 
algorithm.

	At the beginning of a 100mS period
		CurrentWorkLoad=0;
		
	During a 100mS period CurrentWorkLoad is adjusted when a packet
	arrives according to the following formula.
		CurrentWorkLoad+=PacketSize+PacketCost;
		
	At the end of a 100mS period
		if(CurrentWorkLoad>((MaxWorkLoad*(100+ActivationMargin))/100)) 
		{
			if(!FlowControlActive) {
				FlowControlActive=TRUE;
				//Do other flow control initialization
				BurstPeriodCurrentWorkLoad=0;
			}
		}
		if(CurrentWorkLoad<((MaxWorkLoad*(100-DeactivationMargin))/100))
		{
			if(FlowControlActive) {
				FlowControlActive=FALSE;
				//Do other flow control clean up
				Enable Receiver interrupts
			}
		}

During periods where flow control is active, that is 
FlowControlActive==TRUE, the driver will manage flow control by the
following algorithm.

	At the end/beginning of a burst period
		if(BurstPeriodCurrentWorkLoad>BurstPeriodMaxWorkLoad) {
			BurstPeriodCurrentWorkLoad-=BurstPeriodMaxWorkLoad;
		} else {
			BurstPeriodCurrentWorkLoad=0;
		}
		Enable Receiver Interrupts;
		
	When checking if a packet arrives
		if(BurstPeriodCurrentWorkLoad<BurstPeriodMaxWorkLoad) {
			//check for packet normally
			BurstPeriodCurrentWorkLoad+=PacketSize+PacketCost;
		} else {
			//Do not check for packet, but rather
			//  behave as though there is no new packet.
			Disable Receiver interrupts
		}

This algorithm will allow the driver to do a specified amount
of work and then give up the CPU until the next burst period. Doing this
allows the OS to process all the packets that have been sent to it.

So that is generally how the driver manages flow control. For more
detail you can refer to the source code. Now it is necessary to 
describe the exact method for obtaining the optimal flow control 
parameters.

When obtaining the optimal flow control parameters it is important
to note the configuration you are using. Generally there are 8
configurations for each platform. They involve the following options
	DMA or PIO
	16 bit or 32 bit
	118/117/112 or 116/115
Some platforms may only use 16 bit mode. While other platforms may 
have a selectable clock rate. What ever the options are, every combination
should be identifiable, and Platform_GetFlowControlParameters should be
implemented to provide the correct flow control parameters. It is important
to be sure that the carefully selected parameters are applied to the
same configuration used during tuning.

Flow control tuning requires a publically available program called
netperf, and netserver, which are a client/server pair. These are built 
with the same make file and can be found on the web.

Fortunately, as of version 1.10, smsc911x and cmd911x supports an automated
tuning mechanism. The process takes about one hour and can be initiated as
follows

AUTOMATED TUNING:

Choose the configuration you want to tune. 
That is choose between
  DMA or PIO,
  16 bit or 32 bit,
  118/117/112 or 116/115,
Make sure there is a direct connection between the target platform
and the host platform. Do not use a hub, or switch. The target
platform is the platform that will run this driver. The host platform
should be a PC easily capable of sending wire speed traffic.

Install the driver on your target platform with your choosen configuration.
	insmod smsc911xd.o 
	ifconfig eth1 192.1.1.118
load servers on target platform
	netserver
	cmd911x -cSERVER
On host platform, make sure the netperf executable is 
located in the same directory and the cmd911x executable. While in that
directory run the following.
	cmd911x -cTUNER -H192.1.1.118
This command, if successful, will begin the one hour tuning process.
At the end you will get a dump of the optimal flow control parameters.
The key parameters needed are
    MaxThroughput
    MaxPacketCount
    PacketCost
    BurstPeriod
    IntDeas
These value must be assigned in Platform_GetFlowControlParameters to
	flowControlParameters->MaxThroughput
	flowControlParameters->MaxPacketCount
	flowControlParameters->PacketCost
	flowControlParameters->BurstPeriod
	flowControlParameters->IntDeas
Make sure the Platform_GetFlowControlParameters checks the current configuration
and will only set those parameters if the current configuration matches the
configuration you tuned with.

Next start over but choose a configuration you haven't already tuned.
   

MANUAL TUNING:
In the off chance that the automated tuning fails to work properly, you may
use the following manual tuning procedure.

STEP 1:
	Select a configuration. That is choose between DMA or PIO, 16 bit or 
	32 bit, 118/117/112 or 116/115.
	Make sure there is a direct connection between the target platform
	and the host platform. Do not use a hub, or switch. The target
	platform is the platform that will run this driver. The host platform
	should be a PC easily capable of sending wire speed traffic.

STEP 2:
	load the driver on the target platform with the following commands
		insmod smsc911x.o max_work_load=0 int_deas=ID
		ifconfig eth1 192.1.1.118
		netserver
	ID will be replated by the number you will be adjusting to obtain the
		best throughput score in STEP 3, initially a goog number to start
		with is 0.

STEP 3:
	On  the host platform run the following command
		netperf -H192.1.1.118 
	Examine the output. The goal is to maximize the number on the 
		Throughput column.
	If you are satisfied with the throughput remember the ID number
		you used and move on to STEP 4.
	If you would like to try improving the throughput
		unload the driver on the target with
			ifconfig eth1 down
			rmmod smsc911x
		goto STEP 2 and use a different value for ID

	
STEP 4:
	unload the driver with 
		ifconfig eth1 down
		rmmod smsc911x
	load driver on the target platform with the following commands
		insmod smsc911x.o max_work_load=0 int_deas=ID
		ifconfig eth1 192.1.1.118
		netserver
	NOTE: the driver will be making traffic measurements. Therefor
		it is important not to insert any steps between 4 and 6.
		
STEP 5:	
	run netperf on the host platform
		netperf -H192.1.1.118
	repeat two more times.
	
STEP 6:
	on target platform run the following
		cmd911x -cGET_FLOW
	Many variables will be displayed. Two of them are measurements we need.
	You can set the following two parameters as follows.
		MaxThroughput  = RxFlowMeasuredMaxThroughput;
		MaxPacketCount = RxFlowMeasuredMaxPacketCount;
		
STEP 7:
	Unload the driver on target platform with
		ifconfig eth1 down
		rmmod smsc911x
	Apply the parameters obtained in STEP 6 and 2/3 to the appropriate location,
		given the configuration choosen in STEP 1, in
		Platform_GetFlowControlParameters. The parameters for your
		choosen configuration should be set as follows
			MaxThroughput = (RxFlowMeasuredMaxThroughput from step 6);
			MaxPacketCount = (RxFlowMeasuredMaxPacketCount from step 6);
			PacketCost=0; //temporarily set to 0
			BurstPeriod=100; //temporarily set to 100
			IntDeas= (ID from step 2/3).
	recompile driver.
		
STEP 8:
	Again make sure your still using the same configuration you selected
		in STEP 1.
	Load recompiled driver on target platform with the following commands
		insmod smsc911x.o burst_period=BP
		ifconfig eth1 192.1.1.118
	BP will be replaced by the number you will be adjusting to obtain the
		best throughput score in STEP 9, initially a good number to 
		start with is 100.

STEP 9:
	On Host platform run the following command
		netperf -H192.1.1.118 -tUDP_STREAM -l10 -- -m1472
	Examine the output.	The goal is to maximize the lower 
		number on the Throughput column.
	If you are satisfied with the throughput remember the BP number 
		you used and move on to STEP 10.
	If you would like to try improving the throughput
		unload the driver on the target with
			ifconfig eth1 down
			rmmod smsc911x
		goto STEP 8 and use a different value for BP.
		
STEP 10:
	unload the driver on target platform
		ifconfig eth1 192.1.1.118 down
		rmmod smsc911x
	Again make sure your still using the same configuration you selected
		in STEP 1.
	Load the recompiled driver from STEP 7 on target platform with 
		insmod smsc911x.o burst_period=BP packet_cost=PC
		ifconfig eth1 192.1.1.118
	BP will be replaced with the value you settled on in STEP 8/9.
	PC will be replaced by the number you will be adjusting to 
		obtain the best throughput score in STEP 11, typically PC ends 
		up somewhere between 100 and 200.

STEP 11:
	On Host platform run the following command
		netperf -H192.1.1.118 -tUDP_STREAM -l10 -- -m16
	Examine the output. The goal is to maximize the lower
		number on the Throughput column.
	If you are satisfied with the throughput remember the PC number
		you used and move on the STEP 12.
	If you would like to try improving the throughput
		unload the driver on the target with
			ifconfig eth1 down
			rmmod smsc911x
		goto STEP 10 and use a different value for PC
		
STEP 12:
	Apply the parameters to the appropriate location, given the
	configuration choosen in step 1, in Platform_GetFlowControlParameters.
		PacketCost= (PC from step 10/11);
		BurstPeriod= (BP from step 8/9);
	recompile driver.
	Now the values you applied will be the default values used when that
		same configuration is used again.
	Goto STEP 1 and choose a configuration you have not yet tuned.

###########################################################
##################### RX CODE PATH ########################
###########################################################
The purpose of this section is to describe how the driver
receives packets out of the LAN911x and passes them to the
Linux OS. Most functions in the Rx code path start with Rx_

During initialization (Smsc911x_open) the function 
Rx_Initialize is called. This call enables interrupts for 
receiving packets.

When a packet is received the LAN911x signals an interrupt, 
which causes Smsc911x_ISR to be called. The Smsc911x_ISR function
is the main ISR which passes control to various handler routines.
One such handler routine that gets called is Rx_HandleInterrupt.

Rx_HandleInterrupt first checks to make sure the proper 
interrupt has been signaled (INT_STS_RSFL_). If it has not
it returns immediately. If it has been signaled then it decides
if it should use PIO or DMA to read the data.

In both cases the process is like this
    An Rx status DWORD is read using Rx_PopRxStatus
    If there is an error 
        the packet is purged from the LAN911x
            data fifo with Rx_FastForward
    If there is no error 
        an sk_buff is allocated to receive the data
        The data is read into the sk_buff using PIO or DMA.
        After data is read the sk_buff is sent to linux using
            Rx_HandOffSkb
    The process continues until Rx_PopRxStatus returns 0
    
DMA is a little more complicated than PIO because it is written
to take advantage of concurrent processing. To get as much useful
work done as possible while a DMA operation is in progress.
Therefor DMA has the best performance boost when there are 
several packets to service on a single call to Rx_HandleInterrupt

This is the purpose of the INT_DEAS field of INT_CFG. When that
field is set (using the driver parameter int_deas or platform macro
PLATFORM_INT_DEAS) it forces interrupts to be paced, so more packets
can arrive before a single call to the ISR. 

The LAN911x has been proven to receive at about 94Mbps on the
xscale platform. However other platforms run slower and require
some means of flow control. Rx flow control is built into the 
LAN911x. It is configured by writing the AFC_CFG register. The 
user can set this value at load time using the afc_cfg parameter.

Basically it works like this. If the Rx Data fifo fills up to
a level specified by AFC_HI in AFC_CFG then the LAN911x will begin 
flow control. If the link is half duplex then the LAN911x will
exert back pressure by forcing a collision on the wire when a
packet is arriving. This will cause the sender to retransmit later.
If the link is full duplex then the LAN911x will transmit a Pause
frame requesting the partner to stop sending packets. Then when 
the Rx Data fifo drops to AFC_LO in AFC_CFG then the LAN911x will 
stop exerting back pressure in half duplex, or in full duplex it 
will transmit another pause frame that lets the partner know it 
can start sending packets again. See the LAN911x specification
for more information. But all of this is done with out the help
of the driver.

Still the driver must participate in Rx flow control because of
platform speed limitations. Rx flow control in the driver is handled
in the functions Rx_HandOffSkb, and Rx_PopRxStatus. The function
Rx_HandOffSkb calls netif_rx which returns a congestion level.
If any congestion is detected then Rx_HandOffSkb will set the
RxCongested flag. The next time the driver calls Rx_PopRxStatus it
will see the RxCongested flag is set and will not Pop a new status
off the RX_STATUS_FIFO, but rather it will disable and re-enable
interrupts. This action will cause the interrupt deassertion interval
to begin. The ISR will return, and not be called again until the 
deassertion interval has expired. This gives CPU time to linux so it
can handle the packets that have been sent to it and lower the
congestion level. In this case the driver voluntarily stops
servicing packets, which means the RX Data Fifo will fill up.
Eventually the hardware flow control will start up to slow down the
sender. Many times this will still result in an overflow of the 
Rx Data fifo and packets will be lost under heavy traffic conditions.
But if the driver did not release the CPU to linux, then linux would
drop almost all the packets. So it is better to let the packets be
lost on the wire, rather than over consuming resources to service
them.


###########################################################
##################### TX CODE PATH ########################
###########################################################
When Linux wants to transmit a packet it will call 
Smsc911x_hard_start_xmit. This function performs some checks
then calles Tx_SendSkb to send the packet.

Tx_SendSkb works with PIO or DMA depending on the selected
mode. 

The basic sequence is this.
First Write TxCmdA and TxCmdB into the TX_DATA_FIFO.
Then Write the packet data into the TX_DATA_FIFO with 
    adjustments for offset and end alignment.
Then free the skb using dev_kfree_skb

DMA is a little more complicated than PIO because it is written
to take advantage of concurrent processing. To get as much useful
work done as possible while a DMA operation is in progress.
Therefor DMA has the best performance boost when there are
a burst of large packets to transmit.

Tx Flow control works like this.
If the free space in the TX_DATA_FIFO after writing the data
is determined to be less than about the size of one full size
packet then the driver can't be sure it can transmit the next
packet without overflowing. Therefor the driver turns off the 
Tx queue by calling Tx_StopQueue. Then it prepares an interrupt
to be signaled when the free space in the TX_DATA_FIFO has risen 
to an acceptable level. When that level of free space has been 
reached the interrupt is signaled and the handler will turn on
the Tx queue by calling Tx_WakeQueue

Statistic counters are updated after about every 30 packets or
when linux calls Smsc911x_get_stats

########## PLATFORM INTERFACE DESCRIPTIONS ################
###########################################################
The platform interface provides a platform independent
interface for the driver (smsc911x.c) This interface
simplifies the task of porting the driver to other platforms.

All functions that start with Platform_ are part of the 
platform interface. All macros that start with PLATFORM_
are part of the platform interface.

Below are descriptions of PLATFORM_ macros.
for examples of usage see sh3.h, xscale.h or peaks.h

PLATFORM_CACHE_LINE_BYTES
      This macro is set to the size of a cache line in bytes.
      It is used with dma operations to insure cache line 
          alignment which generally improves dma efficiency
      It is also used to insure that the IP header of received
          packets will be aligned on a cache line boundary
          
PLATFORM_IRQ_POL
      This macro is set to 0 or 1 and indicates the default 
      value the driver will use when setting the IRQ_POL bit
      of the INT_CFG register. The user can override this 
      value at load time by setting the driver parameter irq_pol.
      
PLATFORM_IRQ_TYPE
      This macro is set to 0 or 1 and indicates the default
      value the driver will use when setting the IRQ_TYPE bit
      of the INT_CFG register. The user can override this
      value at load time by setting the driver parameter irq_type.
      
PLATFORM_IRQ
      This macro indicates the default irq the driver will
      use when requesting an ISR.
      The user can override this value at load time by setting
      the driver parameter irq.
         
PLATFORM_RX_DMA
      This macro indicates the default dma channel to use for
      receiving packets. It may also be set to the following
      macros
         TRANSFER_PIO = 256
             the driver will not use dma. It will use PIO.
         TRANSFER_REQUEST_DMA = 255
             the driver will call the Platform_RequestDmaChannel
             to get an available dma channel
      The user can override this value at load time by setting
      the driver parameter rx_dma.
      
PLATFORM_TX_DMA
      This macro indicates the default dma channel to use for
      transmitting packets. It may also be set to the following
      macros
         TRANSFER_PIO = 256
             the driver will not use dma. It will use PIO.
         TRANSFER_REQUEST_DMA = 255
             the driver will call the Platform_RequestDmaChannel
             to get an available dma channel
      The user can override this value at load time by setting
      the driver parameter

PLATFORM_DMA_THRESHOLD
      This macro indicates the default value for dma_threshold.
      This value specifies the minimum size a packet must be
      for using DMA. Otherwise the driver will use PIO. For small
      packets PIO may be faster than DMA because DMA requires a
      certain amount of set up time where as PIO can start almost
      immediately. Setting this value to 0 means dma will always
      be used where dma has been enabled.

The platform specific header files (sh3.h, and xscale.h)
must also define the platform specific data structure
PLATFORM_DATA, and its pointer PPLATFORM_DATA.
this structure is passed to most Platform_ functions. It
allows the platform layer to maintain its own context information.

The following are descriptions of the Platform_ functions
for examples of usage see the files sh3.c, or xscale.c
